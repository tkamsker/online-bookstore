I've made the following improvements to implement the backend with Prisma ORM and integrate it with the frontend via a REST API:

Backend Setup:

Added Prisma schema with Book and User models.
Created an Express.js server with API endpoints for books, cart operations, and user login.
Implemented a simple seeding script to populate the database with initial data.
Frontend Integration:

Updated the App component to fetch books from the API and handle cart operations through API calls.
Modified the Login component to send credentials to the backend for authentication.
API Endpoints:

GET /api/books: Fetch all books
POST /api/cart: Add a book to the cart (simulated)
DELETE /api/cart/:id: Remove a book from the cart (simulated)
POST /api/login: User login
Database:

Using SQLite for simplicity, but you can easily switch to another database by changing the Prisma configuration.
To test the application:

The backend server will start on http://localhost:3001
The frontend development server will start on http://localhost:5173 (or another available port)
You can log in with the test user: username "testuser", password "password123"
Note that cart operations are simulated on the backend for simplicity. In a real-world application, you'd want to implement proper cart management, possibly using sessions or JWT for authentication.

To further improve this application, you could:

Implement proper authentication using JWT tokens.
Add more robust error handling and validation.
Implement real cart management in the database.
Add user registration functionality.
Implement a checkout process.
Add more advanced search and filtering options on the backend.
The application is now running with a backend using Prisma ORM and a REST API for frontend integration. 
You can interact with the bookstore, add items to the cart, and log in using the provided test user credentials.
